# Terminal Emulator Implementation Plan

## Architecture

Using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for modularity:

1. **Model**: Stores and manages data
   - Terminal (state, environment, file system)
   - Command (parsing, arguments, options)

2. **View**: Displays the terminal interface
   - TerminalView (output, formatting)
   - PromptView (input, prompt)

3. **Controller**: Processes user input and updates model/view
   - InputController (keyboard events, history navigation)
   - CommandController (execution, routing to handlers)

## Features to Implement

### Core Features
- [x] Command execution
- [x] Command history
- [x] Basic terminal output
- [x] Simulated file system
- [x] Scrollable output
- [x] Tab completion

### Commands
- [x] help - Display help information
- [x] clear - Clear the terminal screen
- [x] echo - Display text
- [x] pwd - Print working directory
- [x] ls - List directory contents
- [x] cd - Change directory
- [x] mkdir - Create directory
- [x] touch - Create empty file
- [x] cat - Display file contents
- [x] rm - Remove files/directories
- [x] whoami - Show current user
- [x] date - Show current date/time
- [x] env - Show environment variables

### Advanced Features (potential additions)
- [x] Tab completion
- [ ] Pipes and redirection (beyond echo > file)
- [ ] Background processes
- [ ] Command aliases
- [ ] More complex file permissions
- [ ] Session persistence (using localStorage)

## Implementation Steps

1. Set up project structure and files
2. Implement basic models (Terminal, Command)
3. Implement views (TerminalView, PromptView)
4. Implement controllers (InputController, CommandController)
5. Implement basic commands
6. Implement file system commands
7. Implement tab completion for commands and paths
8. Add styling and visual improvements
9. Test and fix bugs
10. Write documentation

## CSS Styling Plan

- Dark background with light text (classic terminal look)
- Monospace font for authentic terminal feel
- Different colors for various message types (error, success, info)
- Minimalist interface with focus on functionality

## JavaScript Organization

- Each component in its own file for modularity
- Clear separation of concerns (MVC pattern)
- Minimal dependencies between modules
- Clean, well-documented code with comments

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Command parsing works correctly
- [x] File system operations behave as expected
- [x] Command history navigation (up/down arrows)
- [x] Terminal display formatting
- [x] Error handling for invalid commands
- [x] Tab completion for commands and paths
- [x] Cross-browser compatibility

## Future Improvement Ideas

- Custom themes
- User authentication
- Network commands simulation
- Process management
- Command line games
- Persistent storage between sessions
